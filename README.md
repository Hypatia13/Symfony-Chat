# Symfony-Chat

Simple messaging web application with Symfony for OAMK PHP Frameworks course, implementing database, user authentication and a websocket technology.

## Specification

- Using Symfony version 4
- Php version 7.2
- Websocket

## Development process

Before starting the project I studied Symfony's documentation and its best practices, as well as the  project's skeleton structure and a demo project created with Symfony v4.

This project was made from scratch with the help of resources I linked in this document and it consists of 3 main parts, websocket server for handling messaging, front-end with twig template engine, and a backend that is Symfony MVC framework. In this project database connections are handled with Doctrine and migrations are created via Symfony make command.

Authentication is created with native Symfony security features.
